# iiitb_bcdc - 8 bit bcd counter
## Decsription <br />
The 8 bit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Counter is a counter that counts 100 digits starting from 0 to 99.BCD is an encoding where each digit in a decimal number is represented in the form of bits(usually 4 bits). For example the number 89 can be represented as 10001001 in BCD as 1000 is the BCD representation of 8 and 1001 is the BCD representation of 9.BCD code is also known as 8421 BCD code. This also makes it a weighted code which implies that each bit in the four bit groups representing each decimal digit has a specific weight. As compared to prevalent binary positioning system itâ€™s easy to convert it into human readable representation with the drawback of slight increase in complexity of the circuits.<br />
<br />
The BCD Counter finds application in clock production, clock division, used in minimal power cmos circuit, implemented in frequency counting circuits.<br />
<br />
The 8 bit BCD counter counts from 00000000(0) to 10011001(99). After that it resets to initial value 0 and the process is repeated again. The Verilog code contains 8 bit output and clock, reset & enable as input. The 8 bit BCD counter block diagram is shown in Fig1 and the port list are given in Table1.In Fig2 output waveform for few clock cycles is displayed.<br />
